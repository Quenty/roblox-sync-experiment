class Maid

Description:
	Manages the cleaning of events and other things. Needed to encapsulate state
	and make deconstructors easy

API:
	Maid.new()                        Returns a new Maid object.

	Maid[key] = (function)            Adds a task to perform when cleaning up.
	Maid[key] = (event connection)    Manages an event connection. Anything that isn"t a function is assumed to be this.
	Maid[key] = (Maid)                Maids can act as an event connection, allowing a Maid to have other maids to clean up.
	Maid[key] = (Object)              Maids can cleanup objects with a `Destroy` method
	Maid[key] = nil                   Removes a named task. If the task is an event, it is disconnected. If it is an object, it is destroyed.

	Maid:GiveTask(task)               Same as above, but uses an incremented number as a key.
	Maid:DoCleaning()                 Disconnects all managed events and performs all clean-up tasks.
	Maid:IsCleaning()				  Returns true is in cleaning process.
	Maid:Destroy()                    Alias for DoCleaning()
