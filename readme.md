This project is an experiment left here. I highly recommend looking at [rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo) instead. 

This project is not functional right now past pulling. It used a node server to syncronize roblox items with Roblox studio. Notably, it used long-polling and a syncing system that used MD5 hashes to compare differences before syncing back and forth.

It is being open sourced now because some of the patterns in the code are interesting.
